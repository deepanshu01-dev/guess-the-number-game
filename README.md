# 🎲 Guess The Number Game

A simple Python terminal game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The game provides hints after each guess to guide the user until they win.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The computer generates a random number between **1 and 10**.
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- If the guess is incorrect:
  - The game will respond with **"higher number please"** or **"lower number please"**.
  - The user keeps guessing until the correct number is chosen.
- When the correct number is guessed, the game prints a win message and ends.
